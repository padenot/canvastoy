# What?

> "Like shadertoy, but for 2D canvas."

Live coding environment for &lt;canvas&gt;, for pixel-manipulation kind of
stuff.

Demo at <http://padenot.github.io/canvastoy>

# Why?

I needed a tool to quickly experiment to generate textures for some other
projects.

# How?
1. Write code in the left panel, bound variables are shown at the top.
1. ctrl + enter, or touch the canvas on the right to render
1. goto 1

You can install it as an app, go fullscreen, and restore old versions using the
buttons and the dropdown thingy.

Once accessed once, the app is cached locally. If a new version is available,
it will ask you if you want to update. This will not affect the saved programs.

# For what kind of stuff?
Tailored for procedural texture generation, but it can probably do more. There
are (well, will be) a bunch of algorithm (noises, blur, filters, etc.) directly
accessible.
